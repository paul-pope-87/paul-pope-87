I'm a tech-curious linguist, teacher, and poet who likes to patch things together and figure them out! Currently I work in data rating and annotation for RLHF projects, but here is where I dump some of my coding and analysis adventures. ðŸ“« Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-pope-79b4ba95/)

## Some Previous Projects

### Native Language Identification with BERT:

For my MA in Linguistic Data Science at the University of Eastern Finland, I trained a text classifier to identify writers' native language. You can find the code repository [here](https://github.com/paul-pope-87/NLI_BERT) and the thesis at [UEF thesis repository](https://erepo.uef.fi/handle/123456789/29906)

### Exploring Word Embeddings

This explores various dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms on Finnish word embeddings using R. The code is in [this repository](https://github.com/paul-pope-87/exploring-word-representation), and the project report is available on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/paulpope/923065).

### Linear Modeling with Census Data

This study explores to what extent transportation data can predict income inequality. The code is in this repository, and the project report is available on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/paulpope/1131403).
